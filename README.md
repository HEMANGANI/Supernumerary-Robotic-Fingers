# Supernumerary-Robotic-Fingers
SR Fingers to augment the hand manipulation capabilities. The two SR Fingers, 3 DOF each, are intuitively controlled by patients using IMU and flex sensors attached to their glove. Sensor’s data is fed to a pre-trained ML model, on-board raspberry pi, with a custom-made dataset to recognize the hand gestures hence changing the finger’s functionality accordingly.
